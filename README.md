# askbit-codex

This is a playground to be used with OpenAI Codex to implement a chat interface that can be used in web applications as a helper bot.

## Run locally

The UI is plain HTML/CSS/JS and can be served from any static server.

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

> Tip: You can also open `index.html` directly from the filesystem, but using a local server is recommended so browser security policies treat assets consistently.
